Giuno's bot for the custom game!


TODO
a lot of the code needs fixing; probably change it from OS to some other system
clean the csv file
    
    
make the csv file work properly when converting
scrape the rest of posts (there are extensions to do this)

  the sheet is over there; save it as csv 
  clean the bot up
   clean the arrays start at 0 (probably need to do a -1 somewhere)
   fix the problem with newlines, and fix the problems with emojis not working properly
   
  The bot works by:
   saving the file as a csv locally; then converting the csv to array; then reading each value given as the nth value as an array
 (also fix this readme)
